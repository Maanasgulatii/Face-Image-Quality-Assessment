# Face-Image-Quality-Assessment
An extensive research based project implemented in collaboration. This is a biometrics project focused on developing and evaluating face image quality assessment techniques for face recognition systems.

### Overview
This project implements face image quality assessment methods to evaluate the suitability of face images for recognition purposes. The system analyzes various factors like lighting conditions, pose variations, and image quality to predict recognition performance.

### Features

- Face image preprocessing and normalization
- Feature extraction using MPCA and LPP techniques
- Face recognition using L2 distance measure
- Performance evaluation on FERET and AT&T databases
- Quality assessment metrics for face images

### Technologies

- Python
- VSCode
- Computer Vision Libraries
- Machine Learning
